# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

We will predict which class of iris plant a plant belongs to based on its characteristics.

This is an end-to-end project in data science, where we will be:

    1. Loading the dataset.
    2. Summarizing the dataset.
    3. Visualizing the dataset.
    4. Evaluating some algorithms.
    5. Making some predictions.

## Description
1. `load_dataset()`: Function to load the iris dataset from an online source.
2. `summarize_dataset(dataset)`: Function to summarize the loaded dataset, displaying its dimensions, first few rows, statistical summary, and class distribution.
3. `print_plot_univariate(dataset)`: Function to plot univariate visualizations for the dataset.
4. `print_plot_multivariate(dataset)`: Function to plot multivariate visualizations for the dataset.
5. `my_print_and_test_models(dataset)`: Function to train and test various machine learning models 
    (DecisionTree, GaussianNB, KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminant, SVM) on the dataset using cross-validation.

## Installation
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.
2. Run the provided functions within the Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
3. The main function `my_print_and_test_models(dataset)` demonstrates model training and evaluation.
